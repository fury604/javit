NntpClientV2

When assembling multipart articles in getHeaders(), sometimes an
article ID fails to be added to the headers multipart ID array:

parts length: 275 placeholder: 275 with regex value 276

We see here that 275 is out of bounds. The article had 276 parts, corrected
for array indicies, 275 should be the last element of the array.

However the parts length indicates 275 indicies in the array, which
means the last element would be 274. So this is perhaps NOT the
correct header for this part.
